#### Decisions Made

> * Create a channel on Slack for everyone to share their opinions about the color for the team, the name for the group, the theme for the group, the intro video, and branding of the group so that everyone 
including those that were not present can have a say in the decision.
> * Create a Google Doc called "Group Contract" that is shared with every member to have a rough draft of the group contract that includes the expectations as well as conflict resolutions. 
Additionally, this decision was made to give everyone the opportunity to add suggestions about the contract terms. This would also give everyone ample time to think about
potential terms that they would like to see covered in the document. 
> * Decisions made with regards to the group contract include the following:
> 1. Means of communication: Slack is the primary mean of communication. Zoom is the primary mean for holding meetings. A separate channel on Slack called "meetings" used for meeting announcements and relevant information about the coming up meeting.
> 2. Responding to messages on time and being punctual are expected of everyone.
> 3. Holding a meeting at least once a week to check in with everyone in terms of tracking progress towards the goal of the group.
> 4. Everyone is expected to be flexible, understanding, willing to help others, and willing to communicate to the best of their ability.
> 5. Any issue should be tried to be solved within the group and if there are no ways to solve a particular problem, the manager (TA) will be the outside source of help for solving the issue.
